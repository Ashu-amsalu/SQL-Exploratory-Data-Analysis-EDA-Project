  # SQL-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-Project

  ## Welcome to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
  This portfolio project showcases a comprehensive set of SQL queries designed to perform data exploration and analytics on a retail business dataset that includes customer, product, and sales data.
  
  ### Data Source
  
  This project uses a data warehouse star schema with three main tables:

  ### Table                                      
  gold.dim_customers (Customer dimension table),
  gold.dim_products	(Product dimension table),
  gold.fact_sales (Sales fact table),
  
  These are structured in a star schema, where fact_sales contains foreign keys to customer and product dimensions.

  ### Skills Demonstrated
  
  •	SQL joins (INNER, LEFT JOIN)
  
  •	Grouping & aggregation
  
  •	Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
  
  •	Window functions (e.g., RANK(), OVER())
  
  •	Date functions (DATEDIFF, GETDATE())
  
  •	Conditional logic (CASE WHEN)
  
  •	Data cleansing and filtering
