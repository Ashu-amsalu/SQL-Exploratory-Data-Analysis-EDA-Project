  # SQL-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-Project

  #### Welcome to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
  This portfolio project showcases a comprehensive set of SQL queries designed to perform data exploration and analytics on a retail business dataset that includes customer, product, and sales data.
  
  ### Data Source
  
  This project uses a data warehouse star schema with three main tables:    
  
    - gold.dim_customers (Customer dimension table),
  
    - gold.dim_products	(Product dimension table),
  
    - gold.fact_sales (Sales fact table),
  
  These are structured in a star schema, where fact_sales contains foreign keys to customer and product dimensions.

  ### Skills Demonstrated
  
    •	SQL joins (INNER, LEFT JOIN)
  
    •	Grouping & aggregation
  
    •	Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
  
    •	Window functions (e.g., RANK(), OVER())

    •	Date functions (DATEDIFF, GETDATE())
  
    •	Conditional logic (CASE WHEN)
  
    •	Data cleansing and filtering

  ### Workflow

  ####1. Understand Requirements
  
    •	Clarify the business problem or questions to answer.
  
    •	Identify relevant datasets (customers, sales, products, etc.).
  
  ####2. Data Collection
  
    •	Connect to the database.
  
    •	Explore available schemas, tables, and relationships

  ####3. Data Profiling

    •	Check row counts, distinct values, missing/nulls, duplicates.

    •	Understand data types and constraints

  ####4. Data Cleaning

    •	Handle nulls, outliers and incorrect formats.

    •	Standardize categorical values if needed.

  ####5. Exploratory Queries
  
    •	Aggregate and summarize (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, RANK).
    
    •	Group by key dimensions (gender, marital status, product category or subcategory, Country).
    
    •	Identify patterns and trends.

  ####6. Documentation & Insights

    •	Save queries in a structured way (by theme/question).

    •	Document findings and highlight actionable insights.
